# Hand Gesture Music Controller üéµ‚úã

Control your music player using hand gestures with this Python-based application leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pygame.

---

## **Features**

* üé∂ **Play, Pause, and Control Volume** using hand gestures.
* üîÑ **Switch Tracks**: Move to the next or previous track with simple gestures.
* üëã **Real-time Hand Tracking** using MediaPipe.
* üéõÔ∏è Interactive and user-friendly interface.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Play/Pause Music**

   * Form a circle using your thumb and index finger.
   * The music will toggle between Play and Pause.

2. **Control Volume**

   * Adjust the distance between your thumb and index finger.
   * Smaller distance = lower volume, larger distance = higher volume.

3. **Switch Tracks**

   * Bring your index and middle fingers close together to switch to the next track.
   * Spread your index and middle fingers wide apart to switch to the previous track.

## **Setup and Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Hand-Gesture-Music-Controller.git
   cd Hand-Gesture-Music-Controller
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure to include the following libraries in your `requirements.txt` file:

   * `opencv-python`
   * `mediapipe`
   * `pygame`
   * `numpy`

3. **Add Your Music Files**

   * Update the `playlist` variable in the `app.py` file with the paths to your `.mp3` files.

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## **Usage Instructions**

1. Launch the app.

   * Your webcam will start, and you'll see the camera feed on the screen.

2. Use the gestures as mentioned in the **How It Works** section to control the music.

3. Press `q` to exit the application.

## **System Requirements**

* Python 3.7 or above
* A working webcam
* OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux
